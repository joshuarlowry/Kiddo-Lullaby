# Kiddo-Lullaby
This app will help parents (and grandparents) manage music in the kid's rooms specifically targeted at nap/bed time. This includes triggering specific playlists or songs and changing the volume. There may be other uses. 

There is a complexity around the Spotify/Amazon/Echo setup that makes control complicated, especially when you want to play separate songs in different areas of the home at the same time. The Echo can only be linked to a single Amazon account and the Amazon account to a single Spotify account. A single spotify account has only one play "seat". This means that you may require multiple Spotify and Amazon accounts. This will also prevent you from controlling echo devices in different areas of your home. The Spotify account doesn't allow you to easily switch between these accounts to control music. 

So, if for example, you want to have one set of lullabies playing in room A and another set playing in room B you will need two Amazon Accounts, two (or more) Echos, and two Spotify Accounts. We will call each combination of Amazon Account, Echo, and Spotify Account linked a "zone". This app will hopefully allow you to configure a "page" for these zones for you to control. 

## Assumptions
You must have a Spotify account, Amazon account, and an Echo. They must be linked.
